Name :- Nihar Mamidipudi

Project Summary:-

The project titled Night at the Museum is about exploring the endless potential that VR as a marketing tool can offer. I say marketing tool specifically becuase
that's the parameter that I attempeted to explore and it was a tough two year journey to complete this project and I hope this meets the specifications of evaluation.

Note for the evaluator :- In order to move around the museum you will have use the Google cardboard viewer's button that's there on the top right corner and to listen to the audio look for the text box below the wall mural of the VR agency.
